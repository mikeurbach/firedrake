##Overview

The two main entities in our IM System are the IM Server and the set of IM Clients.
The Server will accept connections from Clients, keep a list of all the currently connected
clients along with their usernames, and inform all connected clients when other clients sign
on or off.  The Server will also relay messages among the different clients that are connected.
These interactions will not only allow all users to know who is signed on at any given time but
also to be able to send messages to any or all of the other connected users.


##Protocol Definition

*SIGNON [username] / [status]
*SIGNOFF [username]
*CHAT [userID(s) or username] [message]
*STATUS [userID(s):username(s)]

###SIGNON
The SIGNON tag is used by the client in connection to the server.  The username is the name that
the user wishes to be viewed as on the IM network.  The username must contain only alphanumeric ASCII
characters or underscores.  The server will store this name and associate it with a specific id number
to make chatting a bit simpler.  The server will also forward this message to all other active clients.
If the username provided by the client fulfills the character requirements and is not already signed on
to the network, then the server sends the SIGNON_SUCCESS tag and adds the user to the signed on list.  The server
also broadcasts the new user's presence to all the other users who are online.
If the username provided by the client is already signed onto the server or if it contains illegal characters
then the server will return the SIGNON_FAILURE tag.  The reason for being declined a connection will also be returned
and displayed to the user.

###SIGNOFF
The SIGNOFF tag is used by the client to inform the server that it is signing off.  The server can then
inform all other clients of the user's departure.  If the SIGNOFF tag is sent to the user, it includes
a username.  The client will then inform the user that the particular username has signed off.

###CHAT
The CHAT tag will be added to any message being sent from a client to the server.  The list of userIDs contains
the ID numbers of users who will receive the message.  The Server will also be able to send messages to every user with the
use of all in place of the username list.  The server will parse out the list, replace it with the name of the sender,
and forward the message to every specified user.

###STATUS
The STATUS tag can be sent from any client to the server, and the server will return a list of userID:username tuples
of those currently signed on to the network.


##Design Decisions
There seem to be two possible strategies in the function of our command-line IM Client. I settled on adding
a keyword and username before each message so that you can easily chat with any user without having to exit
the chat.  This may prove to be annoying for longer conversations, but knowing that IM conversations are
usually short, I decided that chatting with multiple users would be better.
